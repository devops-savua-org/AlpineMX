Alpine Linux (Linux Alpine) doesn‚Äôt have native DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) support built into musl, but you **can enable DoH** using the `dnscrypt-proxy` package. Here's what you need to know:

### üîß DoH on Alpine with `dnscrypt-proxy`

* Install with:

  ```bash
  apk add dnscrypt-proxy dnscrypt-proxy-openrc
  ```

* `dnscrypt-proxy` supports:

  * DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
  * DNSCrypt
  * Oblivious DoH (ODoH)
  * Act as local DoH server for applications/browsers ([wiki.alpinelinux.org][1]).

* To enable DoH server on your machine:

  * Configure `/etc/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml`:

    ```toml
    [local_doh]
    listen_addresses = [":3000"]
    path = "/dns-query"
    cert_file = "localhost.pem"
    cert_key_file = "localhost.pem"
    ```
  * Restart service:

    ```bash
    rc-service dnscrypt-proxy restart
    ```

* Point your device or browser to `https://127.0.0.1:3000/dns-query` for full DoH functionality ([wiki.alpinelinux.org][1]).

### üß© Native DNS over TCP vs DoH

* Alpine‚Äôs musl libc **did not support DNS over TCP** for a long time, only UDP.
* **As of Alpine 3.18 (musl 1.2.4)**, DNS-over-TCP is supported natively, fixing issues with large DNS responses ([The Register Forums][2]).
* DNS-over-HTTPS is **not built into musl**, so `dnscrypt-proxy` is still required for DoH.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature              | Alpine Linux Support            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) | ‚úÖ Yes, via `dnscrypt-proxy`     |
| DNS-over-TLS (DoT)   | ‚úÖ Yes, via `dnscrypt-proxy`     |
| DNS-over-TCP         | ‚úÖ Yes, natively in Alpine 3.18+ |
| Native DoH in musl   | ‚ùå No                            |
